0.14 [02 Aug 2012]
  Too many changes to list since 0.101, here are most of them, in no
  particular order (pardon my lack of proper terminology):
  
  * The data file is now object-free, saving a good 2-3kB of space.
  
  * The class definitions for Noun, Phrase, and Verb have been removed. All
    properties are now elements in huge arrays.
    
  * The subjects and objects arrays have been merged into one Array called
    subjects (how intuitive).
  
  * getRandom(), match_verb_and_subject(), match_verb_and_tense(), and 
    getHeadline() have been repurposed for the object-less data. They
    have become more complex and now have arguments. getRandom() is the
    only function that is backwards-compatible (of course that makes
    no difference, but something to note). These functions, rather than
    using objects and accessing their properties, now use arrays and access
    their indicies via hard-coded numbers.
   
  * getRandom() has had the most changes with two new optional arguments:
      * The second argument ("s") specifies the length of the array data to be
        returned. s's defaults to 1 as to behave like in 0.101 The length of
        the first argument, Array a, must be a multiple of s. This was done
        since Phrases had four properties where as Verbs and Nouns had three.
      * getRandom() has always been more random in that it populates an Array
        with random numbers, then chooses a random element from it. The third
        argument, l, can now set that length. l defaults to 50, the value
        hard-coded in 0.101. This was done because of how expensive creating
        multiple headlines can be. In 0.101, having findHeadline() go through
        its limit of 191 rounds performed 10,696 math operations.

  * match_verb_and_subject() now takes into account the quantity of the
    subject. It started mismatching things... and Soiled can't remember how...
    which is really weird... but it was a side-effect of merging the subjects
    and objects arrays.

  * Timeouts are now called via window instead of, uh, out of the blue. To be
    less ugly, timeouts are no longer use eval() but call functions. Since
    inline functions (or function expressions? Man, I don't know! :P) did
    not work properly, the _setRoulette() and _setFade() functions (explained
    later on) have been created to be used in timeouts. The new arrays
    _curRoul and _fadeTimers store the current/last set of timers for
    their respective duties. This is can be done since window.setTimeout()
    returns a value that can be passed on to window.clearTimeout().

  * printStatus() now handles fade-outs correctly after it has been called
    more than once in a brief period of time. This has resulted in the creation
    of the Array _fadeTimers and the function _setFade(). An object literal 
    argument can now be passed that can specify the time the message stays up,
    and whether or not to fade.

  * roulette() now behaves correctly after it is called more than once in a
    brief period of time. This has resulted in the creation of the Array
    _curRoul and the function _setRoulette(). However, a new bug has popped-up:
    if the array length is small (especially if it's one), it will not pop-up
    immediately, but instead wait for the "curve" to "finish".

  * findHeadline()'s problem of layering prompt()'s has been solved:
    an input#termfield has now been added to the web page and is used instead.
    To be less expensive, it calls getRandom() in such a way as to perform
    at least 1,000 less math operations in a worse case scenario.

0.12 [01 Aug 2012]
  * Using objects to store parts of speech is an inefficent use of bits.
    The data arrays are now strings and ints instead of objects 
    (a good 2-3kB removed), which has made this file larger, harder to read,
    and more hard-coded.
  * Merged objects and subjects together.
  * Removed class declarations.
  * Added some more comments.
  
0.101 [31 Jul 2012]
  * Added putHeadline(), findHeadline(), roulette(), and printStatus().
